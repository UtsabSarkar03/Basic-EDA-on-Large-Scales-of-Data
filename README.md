gender	VARCHAR(10)	Gender of the customer.
product_line	VARCHAR(100)	Category of products sold.
unit_price	DECIMAL(10, 2)	Price per unit of the product.
quantity	INT	Quantity of the product sold.
VAT	FLOAT(6, 4)	Tax percentage applied.

Feature Engineering
To enrich the dataset, the following features were added:

time_of_day: Categorizes transactions into Morning, Afternoon, or Evening.
day_name: Extracts the name of the weekday (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
month_name: Extracts the name of the month (e.g., January, February).
These features enable a deeper analysis of temporal patterns in sales.

Key Queries
Generic Insights
Number of Unique Cities: SELECT DISTINCT city FROM sales;
Branches and Cities: SELECT DISTINCT city, branch FROM sales;
Product Analysis
Unique Product Lines: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_line) FROM sales;
Most Popular Product Line: SELECT product_line, COUNT(product_line) AS cnt FROM sales GROUP BY product_line ORDER BY 2 DESC;
Revenue by Product Line: SELECT product_line, ROUND(SUM(total),2) AS Total_Revenue FROM sales GROUP BY product_line ORDER BY 2 DESC;
Categorizing Product Lines: Products labeled as "Good" or "Bad" based on their sales relative to the average.
Sales Analysis
Sales by Time of Day: Compare weekday vs. weekend sales across time periods (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).
Revenue by Customer Type: SELECT customer_type, ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS Revenue FROM sales GROUP BY customer_type ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 1;
Branch with Above-Average Sales: SELECT branch, SUM(quantity) AS qty FROM sales GROUP BY branch HAVING qty > (SELECT AVG(quantity) FROM sales);
Customer Insights
Customer Type Distribution: Analyze customer types and their contribution to revenue and VAT.
Gender Distribution by Branch: Percentage of male and female customers per branch.
Most Common Payment Method: SELECT payment_method, COUNT(payment_method) AS cnt FROM sales GROUP BY payment_method ORDER BY 2 DESC;
Temporal Trends
Revenue by Month: SELECT month_name, ROUND(SUM(total),2) AS Total_Revenue FROM sales GROUP BY month_name ORDER BY 2 DESC;
COGS by Month: SELECT month_name, ROUND(SUM(cogs),2) AS Total_COGS FROM sales GROUP BY month_name ORDER BY 2 DESC;
Advanced Analytics
Time and Day Ratings by Branch: Identifies when branches receive the most customer ratings.
City with Largest VAT Contribution: SELECT city, ROUND(AVG(VAT), 2) AS vat FROM sales GROUP BY city ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 1;
